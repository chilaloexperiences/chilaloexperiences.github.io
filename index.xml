      <description>The Pacific Hornero: It is a common and recognizable bird that lives in a variety of habitats, but not within the forest; from open fields to towns and cities in the western lowlands and temperate zones in Loja, but not in the east. It is a fairly common species in the city and its surroundings.

      <title>Project 2: Ball Image Classifier</title>

      <description>For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.
I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning.</description>
